# Departures App for PATH

This is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/get-started.html) project targeting Android and iOS.

The App UI is written in [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) with minimal platform-specific code.

The widgets are native by necessity, and written in [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/swiftui-views) on iOS and [Jetpack Glance](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/glance) for Android.

## Setup

You can use any of the following options to work with the code here:

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Standard IDE for editing kotlin/Android code. With the [kotlin multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform), you can run the code on both Android and iOS
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) allows for running the code on iOS, managing iOS simulators, and editing Swift code
